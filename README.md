# DonkeyIsland

# Idea
So our task was to create a game similar to Monkey Island, so I thought about making a new one , called Donkey Island, and here is it.

## Compiling / Playing
You need the SFML libraries.

###Linux
Install the SFML development libraries for your distribution. Ubuntu/Arch Linux ship them in their repositories. After that, open the CMake file in your IDE and compile the target(KDevelop, QTCreator, CLion tested).

###Windows
Just open the Visual Studio solution (.sln) file and compile the target.

# License
I am not sure about the image rights, I found them on Google/Deviantart, and hold no copyright to any of the assets.
However, the full sourcecode is available under MIT license.

Thanks for your interest in my project!
